        <h1>Types of Data and Variables</h1>
        <p>
            In statistics, <strong>data</strong> refers to raw facts, figures, or observations collected
            for analysis. Data helps in understanding patterns, drawing conclusions, and making
            informed decisions in engineering and real-world applications.
        </p>

    <!-- TYPES OF DATA -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Types of Data</h3>
        <p>
            Based on the nature of information, data is classified into the following types:
        </p>

        <h4>Qualitative (Categorical) Data</h4>
        <p>
            Represents non-numerical characteristics or categories.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gender of students (Male, Female)</li>
            <li>Department (CSE, ECE, ME)</li>
            <li>Blood group (A, B, AB, O)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Quantitative (Numerical) Data</h4>
        <p>
            Represents numerical values that can be measured or counted.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Marks obtained in an exam</li>
            <li>Height of students (in cm)</li>
            <li>Time taken to complete a task (in seconds)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- TYPES OF VARIABLES -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Types of Variables</h3>
        <p>
            A <strong>variable</strong> is a characteristic that can take different values for different
            observations. Variables are classified as follows:
        </p>

        <h4>Discrete Variables</h4>
        <p>
            Take countable values.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Number of students in a class</li>
            <li>Number of defective items in a batch</li>
            <li>Number of calls received in a day</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Continuous Variables</h4>
        <p>
            Can take any value within a given range.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Temperature of a room (°C)</li>
            <li>Weight of a person (kg)</li>
            <li>Time taken to run a race (seconds)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- IMPORTANCE -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Importance of Classification</h3>
        <p>
            Understanding the types of data and variables is essential for selecting appropriate
            statistical techniques, probability distributions, and graphical representations.
            This classification forms the foundation for advanced topics in probability,
            statistics, data science, and machine learning.
