        <h3>Types of Events in Probability</h3>
        <p>
            An event in probability is a set of outcomes of a random experiment.
            Understanding different types of events helps in selecting the correct
            probability rules and modeling real-world uncertain situations.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 1. EQUALLY LIKELY EVENTS -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>1. Equally Likely Events</h3>
        <p>
            Events are said to be <strong>equally likely</strong> when each event has
            the same probability of occurrence.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Experiment: Rolling a fair die</li>
            <li>Sample space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</li>
            <li>Each outcome has probability = 1/6</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Equally likely events are commonly used in classical probability problems.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 2. COMPLEMENTARY EVENT -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>2. Complementary Event</h3>
        <p>
            The complement of an event A is the event that A does not occur.
            It is denoted by A′.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            P(A′) = 1 − P(A)
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Event A: Getting a head in a coin toss</li>
            <li>P(A) = 1/2</li>
            <li>P(A′) = 1 − 1/2 = <strong>1/2</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Complementary events help simplify probability calculations.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 3. MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EVENTS -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>3. Mutually Exclusive (Disjoint) Events</h3>
        <p>
            Two events are said to be <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> if they
            cannot occur at the same time.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Property:</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            P(A ∩ B) = 0
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Experiment: Tossing a coin</li>
            <li>Events: Head (H) and Tail (T)</li>
            <li>H and T cannot occur together</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Mutually exclusive events are important in applying the addition theorem
            of probability.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 4. INDEPENDENT EVENTS -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>4. Independent Events</h3>
        <p>
            Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not
            affect the probability of the other event.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Experiment: Tossing a coin and rolling a die</li>
            <li>Event A: Getting a head</li>
            <li>Event B: Getting a 4</li>
            <li>P(A ∩ B) = (1/2) × (1/6) = <strong>1/12</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Independent events are widely used in probability models and machine learning.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 5. DEPENDENT EVENTS -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>5. Dependent Events</h3>
        <p>
            Two events are dependent if the occurrence of one event affects the
            probability of the other event.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B | A)
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Experiment: Drawing two cards successively without replacement</li>
            <li>Event A: First card is an Ace</li>
            <li>Event B: Second card is an Ace</li>
            <li>P(B | A) = 3/51</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Dependent events are commonly encountered in sampling without replacement
            and real-world decision processes.
        </p>
