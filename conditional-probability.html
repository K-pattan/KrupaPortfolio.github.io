    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Conditional Probability</h3>
        <p>
            Conditional probability deals with the probability of occurrence of an event
            when another related event has already occurred. It allows us to update the
            likelihood of an event based on additional information.
        </p>
        <p>
            This concept plays a crucial role in engineering, data science, machine learning,
            reliability analysis, and decision-making under uncertainty.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- DEFINITION -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            The conditional probability of an event <strong>A</strong> given that another
            event <strong>B</strong> has occurred is denoted by <strong>P(A | B)</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="formula">
            P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), &nbsp; P(B) ≠ 0
        </p>

        <p>
            This formula indicates that conditional probability is the ratio of the
            probability of both events occurring together to the probability of the
            conditioning event.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- INTUITIVE MEANING -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Interpretation (Intuitive Meaning)</h3>
        <p>
            When we say <strong>P(A | B)</strong>, we restrict the sample space to only
            those outcomes where event B has already occurred. Within this reduced
            sample space, we then determine the likelihood of event A.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- EXAMPLE 1 -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Example 1: Drawing Cards</h3>
        <p>
            Two cards are drawn successively from a deck of 52 cards without replacement.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Event A: Second card is an Ace</li>
            <li>Event B: First card is an Ace</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Given that the first card is an Ace, the number of remaining cards is 51,
            out of which 3 are Aces.
        </p>

        <p class="formula">
            P(A | B) = 3 / 51
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- EXAMPLE 2 -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Example 2: Defective Components</h3>
        <p>
            A box contains 10 components, out of which 2 are defective.
            Two components are selected at random without replacement.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Event A: Second component is defective</li>
            <li>Event B: First component is defective</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="formula">
            P(A | B) = 1 / 9
        </p>

        <p>
            Since one defective component has already been selected,
            only one defective remains among the remaining 9 components.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- RELATION TO INDEPENDENCE -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Relation Between Conditional Probability and Independence</h3>
        <p>
            Two events A and B are said to be independent if the occurrence of one event
            does not affect the probability of the other.
        </p>

        <p class="formula">
            P(A | B) = P(A)
        </p>

        <p>
            If this condition holds, then events A and B are independent.
            Otherwise, they are dependent.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- APPLICATIONS -->

        <ul>
            <li>Machine learning and Bayesian classifiers</li>
            <li>Reliability engineering and fault diagnosis</li>
            <li>Medical diagnosis and testing</li>

    <!-- SUMMARY -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Conditional probability provides a powerful framework to analyze events
            under partial information. It forms the foundation for advanced concepts
            such as Bayes’ theorem and probabilistic modeling in engineering and data science.
