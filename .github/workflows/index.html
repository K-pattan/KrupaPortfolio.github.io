        <h3>Introduction to the Course</h3>
        <p>
            Probability and Statistics form the mathematical foundation for analyzing data and dealing with uncertainty.
            This course introduces methods to collect, summarize, and interpret data using descriptive statistics and visual tools.
            It also focuses on probability theory and standard distributions to model real-world engineering problems.
            Statistical inference techniques such as estimation and hypothesis testing help in making reliable, data-driven decisions.

    <h3>How This Subject Builds a Foundation for Modern Computing</h3>
    <p>
        Probability and Statistics play a crucial role in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning by enabling models
        to learn from data, handle uncertainty, and make predictions based on probability distributions.
        In Data Science, statistical methods are essential for data exploration, pattern recognition, and hypothesis validation.
        Networking concepts rely on probability to analyze traffic flow, congestion, and reliability of communication systems.
        In Software Engineering, statistical techniques support performance analysis, testing, quality assurance, and
        data-driven decision making throughout the development lifecycle.
