        <h3>Probability Sampling Methods</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Probability sampling</strong> is a method of sampling in which
            every unit of the population has a <strong>known and non-zero
            probability</strong> of being selected.
        </p>

        <p>
            These methods are widely used in statistics because they produce
            <strong>unbiased and reliable results</strong>.

            <li>Simple Random Sampling</li>
            <li>Systematic Sampling</li>

        <h3>1. Simple Random Sampling</h3>

        <p>
            In <strong>Simple Random Sampling</strong>, every unit of the population
            has an equal chance of being selected.
        </p>

        <p>
            Selection is done using lottery method, random numbers, or computer-
            generated random values.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Types of Simple Random Sampling</h4>

        <!-- With Replacement -->
        <h4>1.1 Sampling With Replacement</h4>

        <p>
            In this method, once a unit is selected, it is
            <strong>returned to the population</strong> before the next draw.
            Therefore, the same unit can be selected more than once.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>
            Suppose there are 5 balls numbered 1 to 5 in a bag.
            A ball is selected, its number is noted, and then it is put back.
            This process is repeated.
        </p>

        <p>
            The same ball may appear again in future selections.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Application:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Theoretical probability experiments</li>
            <li>Simulation studies</li>
        </ul>
<br>
        <!-- Without Replacement -->
        <h4>1.2 Sampling Without Replacement</h4>

        <p>
            In this method, once a unit is selected, it is
            <strong>not returned to the population</strong>.
            Hence, the same unit cannot be selected again.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>
            From a class of 30 students, 5 students are selected randomly.
            Once a student is selected, their name is removed from the list.
        </p>

        <p>
            No student can be selected more than once.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Application:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Survey sampling</li>
            <li>Quality inspection</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ====================== SYSTEMATIC ====================== -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>2. Systematic Sampling</h3>

        <p>
            In systematic sampling, every <strong>k<sup>th</sup></strong> unit
            is selected after choosing a random starting point.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px;">
            k = N / n
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>
            If a population has 1000 units and a sample of 100 is required,
            then k = 10. Every 10th unit is selected.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ====================== STRATIFIED ====================== -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>3. Stratified Sampling</h3>

        <p>
            In stratified sampling, the population is divided into
            homogeneous groups called <strong>strata</strong>.
            Random samples are then taken from each stratum.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>
            A college population is divided into departments such as CSE,
            ECE, and ME. Samples are selected separately from each department.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ====================== CLUSTER ====================== -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>4. Cluster Sampling</h3>

        <p>
            In cluster sampling, the population is divided into clusters,
            and a few clusters are randomly selected.
            All units within the selected clusters are studied.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>
            A city is divided into zones. A few zones are selected randomly,
            and all houses in those zones are surveyed.
