    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Definition and Interpretation of Probability</h3>
        <p>
            Probability is a numerical measure that quantifies the likelihood of occurrence
            of an event in a random experiment. It provides a mathematical framework to
            analyze uncertainty and predict outcomes based on available information.
        </p>
        <p>
            In engineering and data science, probability is fundamental for modeling
            uncertain systems, decision-making, and risk assessment.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- DEFINITION -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Definition of Probability</h3>
        <p>
            Probability of an event is defined as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes
            to the total number of equally likely outcomes.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Mathematical Definition:</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
        </p>

        <p>
            The value of probability always lies between 0 and 1:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>P(A) = 0 → Event is impossible</li>
            <li>P(A) = 1 → Event is certain</li>
            <li>0 &lt; P(A) &lt; 1 → Event is uncertain</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- INTERPRETATIONS -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Interpretation of Probability</h3>
        <p>
            Probability can be interpreted in different ways depending on the nature of
            the experiment and available information. The main interpretations are:
        </p>

        <h4>1. Classical Interpretation</h4>
        <p>
            This interpretation applies when all outcomes of an experiment are equally likely.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            P(A) = n(A) / n(S)
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Experiment: Tossing a fair die</li>
            <li>Event A: Getting an even number</li>
            <li>Favorable outcomes = {2, 4, 6}</li>
            <li>Total outcomes = 6</li>
            <li>P(A) = 3/6 = <strong>1/2</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Empirical (Relative Frequency) Interpretation</h4>
        <p>
            Probability is defined as the ratio of the number of times an event occurs
            to the total number of trials, when the experiment is repeated a large number
            of times.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            P(A) = lim (Number of times A occurs / Total trials)
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A machine produces defective items 20 times in 1000 trials</li>
            <li>Probability of defect = 20 / 1000 = <strong>0.02</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Subjective Interpretation</h4>
        <p>
            Subjective probability is based on personal judgment, experience, or belief
            rather than mathematical calculation.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Probability of rain tomorrow based on weather forecast = 0.7</li>
            <li>Probability of project completion on time based on experience = 0.8</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Properties of Probability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1</li>
            <li>P(S) = 1 (where S is the sample space)</li>
            <li>P(Ø) = 0 (impossible event)</li>
            <li>If A and B are mutually exclusive, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
