    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Bayes’ Theorem</h3>
        <p>
            Bayes’ Theorem is a fundamental result in probability theory that provides a
            method for updating the probability of an event based on new information.
            It relates conditional probabilities of events and allows reverse inference.
        </p>
        <p>
            This theorem forms the backbone of Bayesian statistics, machine learning,
            artificial intelligence, and decision-making systems.

    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Statement of Bayes’ Theorem</h3>
        <p>
            If A and B are two events such that P(B) ≠ 0, then the conditional probability
            of A given B is given by:
        </p>

        <p class="formula">
            P(A | B) = [ P(B | A) × P(A) ] / P(B)
        </p>

        <p>
            This formula allows us to compute the probability of a cause (A) given
            the observed effect (B).

            <li><strong>P(A)</strong> – Prior probability of event A</li>

    <!-- NUMERICAL QUESTION -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Numerical Example</h3>

        <p class="question">Question:</p>
        <p>
            Three machines A, B, and C produce 25%, 35%, and 40% of the total output
            of a factory respectively. The percentage of defective items produced by
            these machines is 5%, 4%, and 2% respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            An item is selected at random and is found to be defective.
            Find the probability that it was produced by machine B.
        </p>

        <p class="question">Solution:</p>

        <p>
            Let:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A₁: Item produced by Machine A</li>
            <li>A₂: Item produced by Machine B</li>
            <li>A₃: Item produced by Machine C</li>
            <li>D: Item is defective</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Given:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>P(A₁) = 0.25</li>
            <li>P(A₂) = 0.35</li>
            <li>P(A₃) = 0.40</li>
            <li>P(D | A₁) = 0.05</li>
            <li>P(D | A₂) = 0.04</li>
            <li>P(D | A₃) = 0.02</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            First, compute P(D) using the law of total probability:
        </p>

        <p class="formula">
            P(D) = (0.05×0.25) + (0.04×0.35) + (0.02×0.40)
        </p>

        <p class="formula">
            P(D) = 0.0125 + 0.014 + 0.008 = 0.0345
        </p>

        <p>
            Now apply Bayes’ Theorem:
        </p>

        <p class="formula">
            P(A₂ | D) = (0.04 × 0.35) / 0.0345
        </p>

        <p class="formula">
            P(A₂ | D) ≈ 0.4058
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Answer:</strong> The probability that the defective item was produced
            by Machine B is approximately <strong>0.406</strong>.
        </p>
